# A tuple in Python is similar to a list. The difference between the two is that we cannot change the elements of a tuple once it is assigned whereas we can change the elements of a list.

# In short, a tuple is an immutable list. A tuple can not be changed in any way once it is created.

# empty
t1 = ()
print(t1)
# create a tuple with a single item
t2 = ('hello',)
print(t2)
print(type(t2))
# homo
t3 = (1,2,3,4)
print(t3)
# hetro
t4 = (1,2.5,True,[1,2,3])
print(t4)
# tuple
t5 = (1,2,3,(4,5))
print(t5)
# using type conversion
t6 = tuple('hello')
print(t6)
